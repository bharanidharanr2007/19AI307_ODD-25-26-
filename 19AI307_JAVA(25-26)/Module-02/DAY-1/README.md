## AIM:
To write a Java program to create a class Car with attributes brand, model, and year, create two objects, and display their details.

## ALGORITHM :
1.	Start the program.
2.	Import the necessary package 'java.util'
3. Define a class Car with attributes brand, model, and year.
4. In the main method, create two objects of the Car class.
5. Assign values to the attributes of both objects
6. Print the details of both objects using System.out.println().
7. Stop the program.
